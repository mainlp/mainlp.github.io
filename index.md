# MaiNLP research lab

We are the MaiNLP research lab at [CIS](https://www.cis.lmu.de/) LMU Munich (Munich AI & NLP lab). We carry out research in Natural Language Processing, an interdisciplinary subdiscipline of Artificial Intelligence at the interface of computer science, linguistics and cognitive science. In broad terms, our aim is to make NLP models more robust, so that they can deal better with underlying shifts in data due to language variation.
