How to reach some difficult to find teaching rooms

## HGB (Hauptgeb√§ude) E341

Room E341 in Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1

Note that this room is tricky to find in Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1 (HGB). To reach the staircase to room E341 (which is in the top of the tower), go to the southern inner courtyard (e.g. reachable via the main building or from opposite Amalienstr 77 through the wooden port on the ground level), then take the brown door next to the fountain in the inner courtyard and climb the staircase up to room E341.

Some pictures to illustrate it are here:
