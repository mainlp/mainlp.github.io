title: Making Building NLP Models More Accessible
abstract: AI and NLP are entering more and more disciplines and applications. Individuals, research groups, and organizations who are interested in AI are limited in what they can do, however, due to reasons such as lack of labeled data, complexity of the model-building process, missing AI literacy, and applications that do not apply to their use cases. In this talk, I'll present two projects that aim at lowering the entry barriers to model development. The first part will cover a study on using low-resource techniques for under-resourced African languages. I'll discuss the lessons we learned when evaluating in a realistic environment and the importance of integrating the human factor in this evaluation. In the second part of the talk, I'll present Premise, a tool that explains where an NLP classifier fails. Based on the minimum description length principle, it provides a set of robust and global explanations of a model's behavior. For VQA and NER, we identify the issues different blackbox classifiers have and we also show how these insights can be used to improve models.

bio: Michael A. Hedderich is a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University, working with Qian Yang at the intersection of NLP and AI with HCI. Having a background in both NLP and ML as well as HCI methodology, he is interested in developing new foundational technology as well as building bridges from AI to other interested fields. His collaborations span a wide range of disciplines including archaeology, education, interaction design, participatory design, and biomedicine. Before joining Cornell, Michael obtained his PhD in ML and NLP at Saarland University, Germany, with Dietrich Klakow and was then part of Antti Oulasvirta's HCI group at Aalto University, Finland. Past research affiliations also include Rutgers University, Disney Research Studios, and Amazon.
