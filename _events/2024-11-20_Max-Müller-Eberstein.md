title: "Learning Dynamics Consistencies: Making Language Technologies Accessible for All"
abstract: "Scaling up Language Models has led to increasingly advanced capabilities for those who can afford to train them. In order to enable community-tailored models for the rest of us, we will take a closer look at how and when LM's acquire their linguistic knowledge in the first place—from fundamental syntax and semantics up to higher-level pragmatic features, such as culture. By identifying consistencies in these learning dynamics, we highlight where training efficiency can be improved, and where we hit the limitations of current methods. Finally, we will demonstrate how a deeper understanding of learning dynamics can be applied to improving the accessibility of language technologies for underserved communities, in which collecting sufficient training data is physically impossible."
speaker: Max Müller-Eberstein, <br/>
    Postdoc, IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen (Denmark)
bio: Max is a postdoctoral researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen’s NLPnorth Lab and the Pioneer Centre for Artificial Intelligence, working under the guidance of Anna Rogers. His research focuses on identifying consistencies in how machines learn to enhance training efficiency, particularly for underserved communities. To this end, Max explores the learning dynamics of machine learning models across various languages and modalities. He completed his PhD on Quantifying Linguistic Variation under the supervision of Barbara Plank, Rob van der Goot, and Ivan Titov, focusing on improving the transferability of NLP models across languages and domains. Within MaiNLP and the broader academic community, Max is also known for his engaging presentations, visually appealing slides, and creative posters. So don’t miss out on his upcoming talk!
