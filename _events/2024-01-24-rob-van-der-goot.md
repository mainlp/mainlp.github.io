title: "ROBustness in NLP over the years"
abstract: This talk will consist of three parts 1. Lexical normalization of social media data and its downstream effect on syntactic tasks. 2. Multi-task learning for adaptation in challenging setups. 3. What are open challenges for fundamental NLP tasks like language identification and word segmentation?
speaker: Rob van der Goot<br/>
    Assistant Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen
bio: Rob van der Goot's main interest is in low-resource setups in natural language processing, which could be in a variety of dimensions, including language(-variety), domain, or task. He did his PhD on the use of normalization for syntactic parsing of social media data, one specific case of a challenging transfer setup. Afterwards, he focused on using multi-task learning in challenging settings. Most recently, Rob focuses on more low-level tasks (language identification, tokenization) in challenging settings (cross-lingual, cross-domain, for low-resource languages/scripts).
