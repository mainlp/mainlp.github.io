title: "Consensus is a myth: Human label variation in NLI"
abstract: "Recently more NLP research started to acknowledge that humans diverge in their interpretations in some NLP tasks, and that such variation should be captured if we want to achieve robust language understanding. In this guest lecture, I will briefly show why this matters and then focus on analyzing human label variation in the Natural Language Inference task."
