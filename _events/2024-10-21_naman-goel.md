title: "Towards A Rigorous Science of Synthetic (Language) Data"
abstract: "This informal presentation will provide a potential starting point for discussions with the members of the MaiNLP lab during the week. Recently, there has been a significant interest in synthetic data in a number of settings (from scientific research to commercial products), due to early results showing promise with large language models. However, there are also concerns around issues such as truthfulness, biases, model collapse, etc. Thus, there is a need for further research in the area and developing best practices for generation, curation, evaluation, maintenance and downstream use of synthetic data. The speaker will provide a brief overview of some of his own work that is related to these issues, and open the floor for further discussion."
