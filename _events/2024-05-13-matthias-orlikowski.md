title: "Annotators Aren't Asocial Atoms: Modeling Individual Perspectives and Social Groups"
abstract: "Annotators, like we all, are shaped to some extent by their membership in social groups. Some groups are formed based on socially-relevant categories, like age or gender, others can be more local and temporary. For example, the group of all annotators in the annotation process is just that, a group. If groups have an impact on us, can we include them in our models to better capture variation in annotation?
I will present results from two recent works to provide some tentative answers to this question. In one case we find that groups based on sociodemographics might be too coarse to be informative [1]. In the other we see that it is beneficial to model the annotators of a dataset as a group and in relation to one another [2].<br/>[1]<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.88/\"> https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.88/</a><br/>[2]<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.687/\"> https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.687/</a>
