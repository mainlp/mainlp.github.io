title: "Towards Slightly Less Bad Models: Reliability, Fairness, and Generalization in LLMs and VLMs"
abstract: "<p>Despite remarkable progress and widespread adoption of generative AI tools such as LLMs and VLMs, fundamental challenges remain for ensuring reliability, fairness, and generalization for real-world usage. In this talk, I will discuss research on systematically evaluating and improving the capabilities of models along these dimensions. With respect to reliability, I will present our ongoing work on detecting and resolving uncertainty in legal and medical applications. For fairness, I will discuss LLMs’ cultural bias and how we can make them more cultural competent. Finally, I will present two lines of work testing models generalizability to new contexts — identifying surprising events in videos models and crosslingual knowledge transfer in LLMs.</p>"
speaker: Vered Shwartz <br/>(Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia)
bio: '<p>Vered is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, and a CIFAR AI Chair at the Vector Institute. Her research interests focus on natural language processing, with the fundamental goal of building models capable of human-level understanding of natural language. Her lab is currently working on testing and improving the capabilities of large language models and vision and language models, developing culturally-competent AI, and responsible NLP applications in sensitive domains (e.g., legal, medical).</p><p>Before joining UBC, Vered was a postdoctoral researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) and the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Prior to that, she did her PhD (2019), M.Sc. (2015), and B.Sc. (2013) in Computer Science in Bar-Ilan University. She was part of the Natural Language Processing lab where she worked on lexical and compositional semantics.</p><p>Vered is a member of the UBC NLP Group, CAIDA, Language Sciences, and ICICS.</p>'
