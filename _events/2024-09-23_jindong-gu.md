title: "Toward the Risks Brought by Visual Input into Multimodal LLMs"
abstract: "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and reasoning with textual data. By incorporating visual inputs, Multimodal LLMs extend these capabilities to understand and interpret images, achieving impressive results. Techniques such as Prompting, Chain-of-Thought Reasoning, and Alignment have been particularly effective in enhancing image understanding. In this talk, I will present my research on the risks associated with integrating visual inputs into Multimodal LLMs. Specifically, I will talk about how adversarial images can fool multiple prompts, mislead Chain-of-Thought inferences, and jailbreak the alignment of Multimodal LLMs. At the end, I will also discuss potential mitigation strategies of the risks."
