abstract: "The main aim of this talk is to look for potential synergies between MaiNLP and GPLSI research groups. Therefore, in this talk, I will present the research carried out in the GPLSI Research Group of the University of Alicante (Spain) concerning Natural Language Generation (NLG). I will first provide a brief introductory information about my background and my research group. Then, I will introduce two relevant current projects that deals with NLG as their main topic: 1) CORTEX - Concious Text Generation, and 2) ILENIA project, describing the most recent research that has been developed within them, together with work in progress and future steps. Finally, I will outline some possible activities to do during my visit."
