title: "Causal Strength Judgments in Humans and Large Language Models"
abstract: "In this talk, I will explore the critical role of causal reasoning in both human cognition and artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on how we understand the relationships between events. Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) serve as a fundamental tool for modeling these relationships, using directed, acyclic links to represent probabilistic associations between variables. Deviations from these models can lead to biased judgments.

I will discuss an unexplored bias in causal judgments in humans and large language models (LLMs) by examining two structures within CBNs: Canonical Chain (A→B→C) and Common Cause (A←B→C) networks. Normatively, once the intermediate variable (B) is known, the outcome (C) should be independent of the initial cause (A). However, research has shown that humans often neglect this independence.

Through a study involving 320 participants, we tested the mutually exclusive predictions of three theories of causal judgments using hierarchical mixed-effect models. Our findings reveal that humans perceive causes in Chain structures as significantly stronger, supporting only one of the hypotheses. This increased perceived causal power might stem from our perception of intermediate causes as more reflective of reliable mechanisms.

By subjecting three LLMs—GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and Luminous Supreme Control—to the same queries posed to human participants and adjusting a key 'temperature' hyperparameter, we found that LLMs also display a similar boost in perceived causal power in Chains, particularly with higher temperatures. This suggests that the bias is partly reflected in language usage.

Finally, I will discuss the broader implications of these findings for our understanding of causal representation in both human and AI systems."

bio: Anita Keshmirian, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Head of Data Science at Forward College in Berlin. She completed her Ph.D. at LMU Munich under the supervision of Bahador Bahrami (LMU), Fiery Cushman (Harvard), and Ophelia Deroy (LMU), with subsequent postdoctoral research focusing on Argumentation Machines and Large Language Models at LMU Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (MCMP) and the Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems (IKS). Currently, she is a visiting scientist at the Human-Centered AI division of Helmholtz Munich. Her research interests lie at the intersection of human cognition, causal and moral reasoning, and artificial intelligence, particularly in understanding how both humans and AI models process and represent causal relationships and moral reasoning.
