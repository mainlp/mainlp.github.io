title: "Supporting Human-Human Communication: Towards a Proactive AI Paradigm"
abstract: "Recent years have seen a gold rush towards replacing people with AI agents in communication: they can serve as your therapist, your tutor, your financial advisor, your interviewer. In this talk I will propose a contrasting vision: one where AI is used for supporting humans in their communication while preserving their agency.

Achieving this vision requires moving beyond the current transactional paradigm embodied by current generative AI systems, which are designed to fulfill the immediate goals of a single person, such as answering a question, solving a math problem, booking a flight, or (repeatedly) replying in character. To meaningfully support human-human communication without disrupting or supplanting it, an AI system must instead follow a proactive paradigm: it needs to decide when to intervene to offer support as the interaction unfolds, rather than wait to explicitly be prompted as AI agents and chatbots do today. In this talk I will present initial progress on AI technologies that enable such a proactive mode of operation, and demonstrate communication support tools that embody it.
