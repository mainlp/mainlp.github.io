title: Corpus-based computational dialectology – Data, methods and results
abstract: The CorCoDial (corpus-based computational dialectology) project aims to infer dialect classifications from variation-rich corpora, focusing in particular on the dialect-to-standard normalization task to introduce comparability between different texts. I will start by presenting a multilingual collection of phonetically transcribed and orthographically normalized corpora. This collection forms the data basis of four case studies. In the first study, we investigate to what extent topic models can find dialectological rather than semantic topics. In the second experiment, we evaluate character alignment methods from different research traditions on a range of desirable and undesirable characteristics. The third case study introduces dialect-to-standard normalization as a distinct sequence-to-sequence task and compares various normalization methods used in previous work. In the last study, we focus on neural normalization and investigate what the embeddings of speaker labels can tell us about the origin of the speakers.

bio: Yves Scherrer is a University Lecturer in Language Technology at the University of Helsinki and, from August 2023 onwards, an Associate Professor in NLP at the University of Oslo. He defended his PhD thesis on the computational modelling of Swiss German dialects, with an emphasis on machine translation techniques, in 2012 at the University of Geneva. In 2021, he obtained the title of Docent in Language Technology from the University of Helsinki.<br/>Yves Scherrer has been involved in a wide range of projects in the areas of language technology, dialectology, and corpus linguistics. His current research focuses on the annotation and analysis of dialect corpora as well as on tasks and methods related to machine translation. This research is embedded in the <i>CorCoDial – Corpus-based computational dialectology</i> research project, funded by the Academy of Finland (2021–2025).
