title: "AI Interacting with People (through Language)"
abstract: "I'll discuss three projects related to understanding how people and AI-infused systems can and should interact. In the first, I'll discuss AI communicating to people, in a shared environment, and how we can use highlighting and possible alternatives as a way to combat confabulations (aka hallucinations). In the second, I'll discuss people communicating to AI systems, and how we can leverage language's capability to describe the same behavior at multiple levels of abstraction. Finally, I'll discuss people and AI interacting at the low level of predictive text systems, and how subtle differences in the behavior of the AI system can – or can not – change people's behavior."
