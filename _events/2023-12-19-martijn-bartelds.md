title: "Representing Low-Resource Language Varieties: Improved Methods for Spoken Language Processing"
abstract: Languages are often treated as homogeneous entities, while they are typically composed of multiple varieties. Most language varieties do not correspond to administrative boundaries, such as provinces or states within nations, and they often form a continuum with neighboring varieties. Studying language variation can provide valuable insights into how language varieties relate to their linguistic communities. To this end, it is important to focus on spoken language, as many languages do not have a standard written system.<br/><br/>In this talk, I will introduce our new method to describe and model language variation, which leverages speech representations from self-supervised neural network models to quantify differences between the pronunciations of speakers from different language varieties. This new method assesses the differences between language varieties more accurately and efficiently compared to previously-used methods. Additionally, I will talk about the use of these neural network models to develop speech technology systems that can help empower low-resource language varieties. In particular, I will present our audio-based search algorithm to automatically identify occurrences of a spoken search term in a large collection of spoken materials, improving access to resources that would normally require manual annotation. Furthermore, I will discuss an approach to improve speech recognition performance for several language varieties from different language families. This technology can be a promising step towards the important goal of developing speech technology that is inclusive of the world’s languages.

    Incoming PostDoc at Stanford University
bio: Martijn is an incoming Postdoctoral Scholar in Computer Science at Stanford University, working with Professor Dan Jurafsky. His research focuses on developing and applying natural language processing methods to describe and model resource-scarce languages. He is particularly interested in speech processing with extremely low-resource languages, dialects, and non-native speech. Martijn was awarded his PhD at the University of Groningen (cum laude), where he was advised by Professor Martijn Wieling and Professor Mark Liberman.
