title: "Bridging Knowledge Gaps: Harnessing Embedding Techniques for Knowledge Graph Completion"
abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are the most widely used representation of structured information about a particular domain consisting of billions of facts in the form of entities (nodes), and relations (edges) between them and encapsulate the semantic type information of the entities. Open KGs such as DBpedia, Wikidata, and YAGO, are multilingual and are heuristically created, automatically generated or human-curated. Over the past two decades, KGs have grown in various domains such as government, scholarly data, and biomedical fields and have been used in Machine Learning applications namely entity linking, question answering, and recommender systems. However, these KGs are often incomplete i.e., there are missing links between entities. The talk begins by elucidating the significance of KG completion in enhancing comprehensiveness. It highlights the role of ML algorithms in leveraging the existing structure and semantics encoded within KGs to predict and infer missing links, thereby enriching the knowledge representation. However, existing research has focused mostly on monolingual KGs, leaving multilingual KGs unexplored. This talk also discusses the open challenges and research gaps in multilingual KG completion.
